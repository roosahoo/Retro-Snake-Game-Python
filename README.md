# Retro Snake Game // Python & Pygame

Here is the classic Snake game, a simple yet incredibly addictive experience. While it may seem basic by todayâ€™s standards, it was a huge success in its time. I developed this version using Python and the Pygame library.

Despite its simplicity, Snake incorporates many fundamental elements of game development, such as movement, controls, collision detection, scoring, and more. To enhance the experience, I also added sounds to the game.
